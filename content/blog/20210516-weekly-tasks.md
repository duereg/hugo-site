# Overview

In re-reading [High Output Management](https://amzn.to/3Dw1oUF) recently, I was particularly interested in reading over Andy Grove's schedule and seeing how he spent his time. I thought it might be interesting to post something similar to how I allocate my time throughout the year.

## Regular Occurring Events:
Weekly 1:1’s with all direct reports
Weekly 1:1’s with PM, Design, etc
Weekly 1:1's with my manager

Monthly Career Conversations with direct reports

## Quarterly Meetings
### Beginning/End of Quarter
Review Previous Quarter & how we did on our Goals

### Halfway through Quarter

## Biweekly (Assuming 2 week sprints):
