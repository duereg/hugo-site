## More Shared Knowledge on Projects
- Include more people in code reviews even if they're not actively picking up development tasks -- this shares out knowledge of the changes and gets another set of eyes that can ask good questions
- Break team silos, share knowledge
- Do Team PR's for big PR's
  - Ideally break work into small pieces though
- Do team share of projects for tech projects, share knowledge
- Team Collab!

## Metrics/Monitoring/Data
- Implement monitoring and error visibility to make it easier to debug problems down the road.
- Data driven approach whenever we can to illustrate impact. This can be something we start collection at the beginning and continue through out the project.
- implement monitoring & debugging for every milestone, every deliverable

## Testing & Tech Debt
- Automated testing early in the process
- Test Plan/Test Matrix up-front
- Fix broken windows along the way
    - broker time for tech debt
    - broker time for related bugs in the backlog

## Status Update/Communication
- Constant, detailed, concise status updates in channel -- this is particularly helpful when rolling new people on because you can say "please go back and read the content of the channel for the past week"
- Frequent check-ins/deliverables
- Customers/Users to consult with along the way
- highlight risks early and often
    - Clear Communication of Risks, Early & Often
- Roll out plans
- Disorganization from not knowing what work streams are in progress and who is working on what tasks
- Clear Status Updates in Channel
    - Nice for on-boarding new folks
- clear comms, high vis

## Kickoff & Milestones
- Clear Milestones
  - What is the smallest thing we can deliver to our customers/partners so they can validate our approach?
- Clear outline of project goals and milestones, this helps us fall back on the main objective when things get unorganized
- Kick Off!
    - Celebration, where we're going
    - Outline what we want to build
    - Why we're doing it
    - Is how that important?
    - What you're going to do is not that important
- ðŸŽ‰ Continue celebrating small wins!
- You need time devoted to design, review, write tech specs
- You need time for fast-follow work that you uncover along the way
- Clear Project Goals & Milestones
    - when things get disorganized, what to do

## Project Task Tracking Doc
- Keeping a separate project doc that tracks tasks and stories. It can be a bit of a pain to manage and sometimes is a couple days out of date, but I've found it very helpful in keeping alignment on the work left to do for a project
- Take into accounts bugs and broken windows you can fix along the way
- Donâ€™t be too fine grained on certain tasks
    - Things can be rough if clear. You donâ€™t need a page long ticket for a one line change
 Tech Specs / RFCs
- Pre-planning for any project should begin much before the actual work
    - Getting familiar with code base
    - Setting up environment
    - etc etc
- Tech specs or brain storming sessions that involve the entire team in the design process.
- Create a detailed design doc to iron out the implementation details
    - no matter how small the feature/project is
    - take them through the appropriate design reviews
- RFCs
    - Full RFC overview right before the official kick-off.
    - could be an engineering focused project where we comb through assumptions and highlight any risks.
    - This might also help with setting original expectations on delivery date

## Swarming
- Full Team Swarming has value
- Reduce having single developers on projects
- Attempting to breakdown work or introduce parallelism for projects that were not initially designed that way can cause problems.
- Figure out in the design phase what work that can be done in parallel (planning for multiple developers)
