In a recent performance evaluation, Jane (name changed to protect the person involved) received negative feedback on her soft skills without any specific examples. Her manager only gave her general advice and insisted that as a senior, she "should know" what the issues were. Jane's peers had only mentioned that she was too direct in her communication and that she had conflicts with a mid-level peer who ignored her code review suggestions. Jane never complained to her manager about the conflicts, as she felt it was her responsibility to manage them. However, this negative evaluation came as a surprise to her, and now she has changed teams with a new manager who knows about the bad review.

When you receive negative feedback on your soft skills during a performance evaluation without specific examples, it can be challenging to improve. Her previous manager gave her general advice and insisted that as a senior, she "should know" what the issues were, but Jane had no concrete reference to work with.

Fortunately, Jane has since changed teams and has a new manager who knows about the bad review. This new context provides an opportunity for Jane to ask for more specific feedback or establish improvement indicators to have a reference. This can help her work in a more constructive environment with her new manager.

In addition, Jane could talk to her new manager about the situation and ask if they can get any missing information from the previous manager. It's possible that such feedback may not exist, but it's worth exploring this option.

If Jane is unable to get specific feedback, she can still ask for actionable measures to improve. It's also recommended that she seeks resources like books or courses on leadership and self-development to learn how to be a positive leader in the workforce.

Lastly, it's important for Jane to be open to growth and communicate with her new manager that she wants to work on improving her behaviors. This approach shows that she is willing to learn and improve, which can make a positive impression. Overall, seeking specific feedback and establishing improvement indicators is crucial for identifying areas for growth and improvement.

Overall, the consensus is that Jane should seek specific feedback to identify areas of improvement and work with her new manager to establish improvement indicators. It's also essential for her to be open to growth and learn how to be a positive leader in the workforce.
