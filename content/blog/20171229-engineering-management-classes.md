Two classes I recommend for potential new engineering managers.

The course is designed to help new managers develop foundational skills in management and leadership.

The course covers several key topics, including:

* Understanding the role of a manager and developing a management philosophy
* Building effective teams and managing team dynamics
* Developing and executing strategy
* Managing operations and projects
* Building and managing relationships with stakeholders
* Leading change and managing transitions

The course is divided into several modules, with each module covering a specific topic. The modules include video lectures, readings, case studies, and exercises to help learners apply the concepts in real-world situations. The course also includes discussion forums and opportunities to connect with other learners to facilitate collaboration and learning. The course covers 3 days, has great teachers, and teaches you basic skills needed to run a small business or team.

Overall, the course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to management and leadership, with a focus on practical skills and tools that new managers can apply in their day-to-day work.
