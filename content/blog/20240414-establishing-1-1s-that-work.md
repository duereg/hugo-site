The primary purpose of one-on-one meetings is to give your reports a chance to discuss issues and topics they find important. It’s an opportunity for them to raise concerns, challenges, and ideas that might not surface during regular team meetings. This is not a meeting for status updates—schedule separate time for that. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Frequency and Duration

These meetings should be held regularly, ideally once a week, and last 30–60 minutes. For new employees, initial sessions may be longer to accommodate onboarding questions; for senior staff, biweekly 30-minute sessions can suffice. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Agenda Setting

The agenda should be set primarily by your direct report to focus on their priorities. You may add agenda items as needed. Maintain the agenda in a shared doc, Slack channel, or calendar invite for continuity. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Manager’s Role

As the manager, your job is to listen actively, ask probing questions, and offer guidance. Use these sessions to uncover obstacles, understand work styles, and coach your reports—rather than review status updates. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Building Trust

One-on-ones are a safe space for candid discussions. Feedback requires:  
- **Safety:** Reports must feel secure giving and receiving feedback.  
- **Effort:** Feedback should be easy to provide and receive without defensiveness.  
- **Benefit:** Ensure feedback leads to action, even if it’s simply communicating constraints. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Performance and Development

Use one-on-ones to discuss performance feedback and professional growth. Separate deep career-planning conversations can complement, but not replace, regular 1:1s. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## First and Regular Agendas

**First Meeting:** Focus on getting to know each other—ask about work preferences, meeting cadence, communication style, and support needs.

**Ongoing Meetings:** Start with the report’s agenda and address items in priority order. Capture topics in your shared notes and revisit them each session. Urgent issues can be handled outside the standard cadence. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## Conclusion

Effective one-on-ones build trust, facilitate open communication, and drive development. Tailor the frequency, agenda, and feedback loops to each report’s needs, and you’ll set a strong foundation for growth and collaboration. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
