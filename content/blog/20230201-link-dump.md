## Engineering Leadership Principles

The article "[Engineering Leadership Principles](https://hugodias.substack.com/p/engineering-leadership-principles)" by Hugo Dias outlines six principles that he believes are crucial for effective engineering leadership:

* Build trust through transparency and communication
* Foster a culture of learning and growth
* Prioritize quality and reliability
* Lead with empathy and emotional intelligence
* Build strong, diverse teams
* Empower your team to take ownership and make decisions

Dias provides examples and anecdotes to illustrate each principle and explains why they are important. He also notes that while these principles are essential for engineering leadership, they can also be applied to leadership in other industries.

## How to Onboard into a New Job

The article titled "[How to Onboard into a New Job](https://softwareleads.substack.com/p/how-to-onboard-into-a-new-job)" provides tips and recommendations for professionals who have started a new job and want to make the most of their onboarding process. The author suggests that new employees should take advantage of the opportunity to learn about the company's culture, processes, and expectations, as well as build relationships with their colleagues and stakeholders.

The article provides several practical suggestions for new hires, such as scheduling one-on-one meetings with key stakeholders, asking questions, taking notes, and setting goals for their first few months. The author emphasizes the importance of being proactive and taking ownership of one's own onboarding process, rather than expecting the company to provide all the necessary guidance and resources.

The article also recommends that new employees take the time to understand their team's priorities and goals, as well as familiarize themselves with the tools and technologies used by the company. The author suggests that new hires should seek feedback and communicate openly with their manager and team members, and take advantage of any training or development opportunities offered by the company.

Overall, the article encourages new hires to approach their onboarding process with a positive attitude, curiosity, and a willingness to learn and adapt to their new environment. By taking an active role in their onboarding process, new employees can set themselves up for success and integrate more effectively into their new role and organization.

## Six Coding Interview Formats

The article proposes [six alternative coding interview formats](https://hoffm.medium.com/six-coding-interview-formats-to-replace-leetcode-84f3c770b5c1) that can be used to replace LeetCode-style interviews. The author argues that while LeetCode-style interviews are effective in measuring algorithmic problem-solving skills, they do not reflect the realities of day-to-day coding work. The proposed alternative interview formats are:

Pair Programming: The candidate pairs up with an interviewer to solve a coding problem together, allowing the interviewer to observe the candidate's coding skills in real-time.

Code Review: The candidate is asked to review and provide feedback on a codebase, demonstrating their ability to identify bugs, improve code quality, and communicate effectively.

Design Discussion: The candidate is asked to design a system or feature, showcasing their ability to understand requirements, identify trade-offs, and communicate technical concepts clearly.

Debugging: The candidate is given a codebase with bugs and is asked to identify and fix them, demonstrating their ability to navigate complex codebases and debug effectively.

Existing Project: The candidate is asked to work on a real project from the company's codebase, allowing them to see the kind of work they would be doing if they joined the company.

Take-Home Assignment: The candidate is given a realistic coding assignment to complete on their own time, allowing them to work at their own pace and showcase their ability to write code independently.

The author argues that using alternative interview formats can provide a more accurate assessment of a candidate's coding skills and fit for the company, while also creating a more inclusive and equitable hiring process.
