As a development team, tracking velocity is a common practice to measure how much work they can fit into a sprint. However, using velocity for any other purpose is not advisable. This is because the number might not reflect the real progress of the project and can be flawed as a planning mechanism.

As a manager, it might be necessary to push teams to a certain agenda. A flat velocity line can be used as a proxy metric for cross-cutting concerns, such as investing time in infrastructure to reduce future costs in a certain area. However, it's important to note that this should be resolved within the team rather than the organization.

Cycle time can be a better metric for such use cases, as it measures the time it takes for a ticket to move from the "in progress" stage to "done." Normalizing the data for days worked, tracking moving averages over 1, 3, and 5 sprints, and even using deeper retrospectives to understand trends in the data can help teams make more informed decisions.

It's crucial to understand that each team defines what a point means for them, making velocity not useful for comparing teams with each other. Therefore, the team can track their own velocity to have a better gauge of their progress and how much they can fit into a sprint. The teams are self-organizing, and how they want to track velocity is up to them.

In summary, tracking velocity can be a helpful tool for development teams to plan their work, but it should be used cautiously and only for its intended purpose. Cycle time can be a better metric for measuring progress towards cross-cutting concerns, and each team should define their own points to avoid comparing teams with each other.
