Back when we were all the office together, it was pretty easy as a manager to get a feel for how the team was doing. Are folks getting along? Are folks stressed? Does everyone have the right balance of work? With folks all around you, it was pretty easy to drop in on a conversation, take someone to lunch, or grab a coffee and talk.

These small encounters gave you a chance to make sure your team was running efficiency, it also gave your team a chance to speak to you as a human being outside of formal settings. Usually that level of shared vunerability led to better, more fulfilling conversations in the following 1:1's.

With the traditional office gone, all of the luxurious interactions managers had when we shared physical space are gone. I started a new job 9 days before shelther in place, so I didn't have much time to meet my team to get to know them. I noticed quickly that the level of trust and sharing wasn't where I expected it to be.

Given I had none of the in-person tools for building trust with my team that I had developed over the years, I knew I had to be more prescriptive in building trust with my team. So what did I do?

## Overshare (a bit)

I'm a relatively private person. I don't like to talk about my personal life in group settings. However, to build trust with a group, it helps to show that you trust them and can confide small details about your life with them.

Would I tell my team that my partner and I had a fight? No. I don't want to overshare or make them uncomfortable.

However, details of my life I normally wouldn't broadcast, I've shared more in an attempt to be a bit vunerable and build closeness with my team. Things like:

* Whether I've been sleeping well or not
* How my dogs are doing
* How I'm dealing with being remote (or not dealing with it)

Some moments of vunerability to allow the team to get to know me, and hopefully feel comfortable enough to be themselves around me as well.

## Be more prescriptive in getting to know them

## Make more time for them

## Set reminders to yourself
