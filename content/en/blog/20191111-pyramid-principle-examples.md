I use [SCQA](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/storytelling-amp-presenting-1-thank-you-barbara-minto) all the time in my communications both up to leadership and down to my teams.

This [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself) from Derek Sivers is a great example of someone using SCQA to communicating a problem and a suggested solution in a short amount of time. Worth watching if you're looking to use SCQA in your own communications.

Another example of an SCQA structured communication is something I received at work:

```
Phishers and scammers are actively targeting employees on LinkedIn and email
(work and personal) in hopes of accessing valuable information.

Every employee, whether you realize it or not, has insider knowledge -
it may be access to financial data, technical resources, customer contacts,
intellectual property, customer data, or other resources –
and there are people who will try to exploit that.

What can you do?
Do not click the link, open the attachment, or respond to the sender
Forward a copy to phishing@company-corp.com
Use the Spam button in GMail
If it’s a LinkedIn message, text message, or other non-Company-Corp
message that feels suspicious, please report it to security

...Additional Evidence...
